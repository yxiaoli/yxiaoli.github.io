## Find out what type is your computer's CPU
using the command `lscpu`

## ARM vs. x86


|  Types   |ARM | x86 |
|:---------|-----|------:|
|    ISA   |RISC| CISC|

whenever we mention the ARM vs. x86, it sounds like a fight between Apple and Intel+AMD.
**ARM** processors one of CPU's type, stands for `Advanced RICS Machine`. More commonly used `x86` processors made by Intel and AMD use the `CISC`. 


## CPU architecture types
Instruction set architecture (ISA) is a description of computer architecture based on a command
set it can execute. Usually we categorize it into two types:

1. **Complex Instruction Set Computers(CISC)**

	* Powerful, complex instructions
	* Instructions are variable in length (1 - n bytes)
2. **Reduced Instruction Set Computer(RISC)**
	* Fixed instruction length
    * Enables efficient pipelining & high clock frequencies
	* Clear distinction between data loading/storing and manipulation

##  Little Endian vs. Big Endian

**Big Endian Byte Order**: The **most significant byte** (the "big end") of the data is placed at the byte with the **lowest address**. The rest of the data is placed in order in the next three bytes in memory.

**Little Endian Byte Order**: The **least significant byte** (the "little end") of the data is placed at the byte with the **lowest address.** The rest of the data is placed in order in the next three bytes in memory.

## Glossary
**Bandwidth(B)**: Maximum data rate that can be held during a transfer

**Message Passing Interface (MPI)** : 
Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a community driven specifi-
cation for the message-passing model.

**Mooreâ€™s law**: The observation made by Gordon Moore that the number of transistors in an integrated
circuit doubles roughly every two years.
